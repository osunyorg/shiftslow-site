<p>My roots lie in the lower Rhine area in Germany, in a little village in which I grew up with my family. Alumna of the MA in Arts and Heritage at Maastricht University, I worked with XR in the Netherlands on art activism as transformative climate change communication. Currently I co-create a community based militant podcast as my end project for the MA Political Ecology at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. For this podcast project, I moved to a community-based environmental education center in the South of Spain which is currently fulfilling me with a lot of passion for action towards local resiliences.</p>
