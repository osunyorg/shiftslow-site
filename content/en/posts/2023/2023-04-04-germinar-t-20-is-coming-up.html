        <p>The degrowth based art-residency Germinar-t is going into the second round with a focus on performance art!! It will again take place in and with the Sunseed Desert Technology community in Los Molinos del Rio Aguas, Almeria. The performance group in residency, is the Lab of Rooted Imagination from Barcelona. They have formed in October 2022 and made their debut with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/estudio1/">#estudio1</a> on activist struggles in January 2023. <br><br>Germinar-t 2.0 is taking the form of a 10-day process of creating a performance around water cultures, ending in the festival del Agua, which Sunseed co-hosts each spring. The process is informed by art-based-research practices: the community collaboratively researches into their own relation to water cultures before the performers arrive. These findings are fermented into stories, poems, little plays which are presented to the performers in residency as process of 'soaking' into the place and the territory. During the week, the performers play and create based on the collection of stories they received. At the festival, the performers in residency have the opportunity to present what they worked on during the residency and open up the investigation to the territory.<br></p>
