We want to explore the following questions:<br>How to inspire for degrowth?<br>How to spread degrowth?<br>How to create spaces to practice degrowth?<br>How to educate about degrowth?<br>In the mornings there are in depth holistic workshops around each of the questions. In the afternoons, we invite for co-creation, wanna explore hosting a workshop on degrowth and related topics? Then this is your space! In the evenings we expect concerts, poetry nights, art performances, jam sessions and on the last night, a party to which local DJs come from the Viennese scene.
