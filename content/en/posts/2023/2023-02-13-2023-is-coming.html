        <p>From the 12 - 19 August 2023, we invite once again to Kunst in der Natur in the Viennese forests. A one week long of transformative degrowth education. We want to explore the following questions:</p><ul>  <li>How to inspire for degrowth?</li>  <li>How to spread degrowth?</li>  <li>How to create spaces to practice degrowth?</li>  <li>How to educate about degrowth?</li>  </ul><p>In the mornings there are in depth holistic workshops around each of the questions. In the afternoons, we invite for co-creation, wanna explore hosting a workshop on degrowth and related topics? Then this is your space! In the evenings we expect concerts, poetry nights, art performances, jam sessions and on the last night, a party to which local DJs come from the Viennese scene.Â </p>
