    <p>a festival  <br>Every summer since 2022 AltShift brings together approximately 200 people around the topics of degrowth, eco social futures, global justice and solidarity.The people who join are a wild bunch; from young activists and students, to more seasoned movement organizers; from eco socialist to anarchists; people involved in activism, politics, the arts-sector, education, academia or cooperatives.And that's the beauty of it, to connect, exchange, discuss, dance, cook, plot the revolutions yet to come, and celebrate the ongoing ones.</p>
