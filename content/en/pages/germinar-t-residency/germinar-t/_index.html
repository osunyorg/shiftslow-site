    <p>degrowth art residencies  <br>We want the degrowth movement to be more colourful, creative, artistic, playful, experimental, embodied ... through arts! Degrowth is still sooo academic, we want to move it into our communities by holding creative spaces of artistic co-creation. In the art residency, we focus on co-creating degrowth-based art practices. We want to invent, embody and inhabit them together. The art residency allows us to create a community around collaborative artistic processes for further action, exchanging and creating tools for art based degrowth practices. Germinar-t happened in December 2022 and again in April 2023. We hope to create another edition of the residency in 2026. </p>
