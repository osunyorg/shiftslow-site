    <p>  <br>Shift Slow is an independent cultural association established in 2021. We understand ourselves as part of a movement aiming for a just transition to eco social futures. Our purpose is to create spaces for transformative education, using arts-based methodologies and critical contents around the topics of post-growth, decoloniality, queer feminisms, global justice, and social movement alliances. You are planning a conference, camp, festival, course, workshop, residence, symposium, gathering around these topics? Reach out to us! If we can, we are happy to support in organizing, give workshops/inputs or rock up with interactive art installations. We are based across Europe so it might be helpful to have a look at the person in the team who is closest to you topic and locationwise.</p>
